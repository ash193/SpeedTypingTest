Solar energy harnesses the power of the sun through photovoltaic cells,
converting sunlight into electricity. Advances in solar technology have made it more efficient and affordable,
leading to widespread adoption in both residential and commercial sectors. Wind energy,
captured through wind turbines, is another rapidly growing source of renewable energy.
Wind farms, often located in rural or offshore areas, generate substantial amounts of electricity without
emitting greenhouse gases.
